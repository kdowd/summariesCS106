			<p class="text-1">
				Rallypoint is a tech startup located in Auckland NZ and has contracted you to develop their app for
				initial
				release.
			</p>
			<p class="text-1">
				Primarily focused on event promotion they have given you a list of must have features for the app which
				are;
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<p class="text-1">Users must be able to view all events posted globally.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p class="text-1">
						Access to social media aspects including chats and video and image interaction without requiring
						further
						verification than the initial account setup.
					</p>
				</li>
			</ul>

			<p class="text-1">
				The second part of the required features includes a semi automated verification system for hosts, which
				will
				determine whether or not a user is eligible to become a verified host and begin posting events.
			</p>
			<p class="text-1">
				This verification should include at least one of the following, Identity and/or Location verification.
			</p>
			<p class="text-1">
				And finally the app should be deployable across mobile platforms either ios and or android, along with
				web and potentially desktop compatibility. Apart from these mandatory features Rallypoints executives
				have given
				you developmental discretion in regards to other features of the application.
			</p>

			<p class="text-1">
				As this is a startup company Rallypoint has requested that dev costs and hosting should be kept to a
				minimum and therefore have chosen to contract you as they believe you will be able to create a
				functioning app
				that is set up for scaling right from the start all while maintaining budget friendly.
