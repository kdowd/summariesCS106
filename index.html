        <p class="text-1">
          I am developing an Employee Management System for New Zealand Finance and Trade Company (NZFTC) using WPF with C# and XAML, connected to a MongoDB database. The system has two types of users: administrators who can manage all employee information, payroll, and leave requests, and employees who can view their own details, apply for leave, and submit complaints. The main features include secure login, employee database management, leave request processing, automatic salary calculations with pay slip creation, and a system for tracking employee complaints. This project will help NZFTC move from paper-based HR processes to a digital system that makes everything more efficient. The project will take four weeks to complete with a budget of $16,000, and it will showcase my skills in building desktop applications, working with databases, and solving real business problems.

        <p class="text-1">
          The Employee Management System is a desktop application built using WPF, C#, and .NET 8.0, with MongoDB Atlas as the database. It's designed to help a company manage its employees efficiently, catering to
          different roles like Admins, Managers, HR, and regular Employees. So far, we've implemented core features like adding, viewing, editing, and deleting employee records (CRUD operations), with role-based access
          (e.g., Admins see more details than Guests). We've also added login functionality, connected to MongoDB Atlas for data storage, and set up a tabbed interface in the main window (Employees, Dashboard, Leave
          Requests, Payroll, Admin). Currently, we're working on additional features like expanded user roles, leave requests, and payroll management, ensuring the system is secure, user-friendly, and scalable.

            <p class="text-1">
              As a new user, I want to log in with my username and password so that I can access the system securely. When I open the app, I see a login window where I can type my username (e.g., "admin") and password
              (e.g., "admin123"). If I enter the correct details, I’m taken to the main screen with tabs like "Employees" and "Admin." If I click "Cancel," I can still use the app as a Guest but with limited access.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p class="text-1">
              As a Guest user, I want to view a limited list of employees so that I can see who works here without accessing sensitive details. If I skip the login by clicking "Cancel," I enter the app as a Guest. In the
              "Employees" tab, I see a table with just the Name and Position of employees—no Contact or Role details. Restricted tabs like "Admin" and "Payroll" are hidden from me.
            </p>

              As a Manager, I want to edit an employee’s details so that I can fix mistakes or update their information. In the "Employees" tab, I select an employee (e.g., "John Doe") from the list and click an "Edit"
              button. I can change details like their Position (e.g., from "Developer" to "Senior Developer") or Contact, then save. The updated details show up in the list right away.

              As an HR person, I want to delete an employee who has left the company so that our records stay accurate. In the "Employees" tab, I select an employee who’s no longer with us (e.g., "Jane Smith"), click a
              "Delete" button, and confirm the action. The employee disappears from the list, ensuring our records only show current staff.

              ID, Name, Position, Contact, Role, and Date of Birth. This helps me keep track of who’s on the team and their roles.

            <p class="text-1">
              As an Admin, I want to add a new employee to the system so that we can keep our records up to date. In the "Employees" tab, I click a button to add a new employee. I fill in their details—like Name (e.g.,
              "Sarah Lee"), Position (e.g., "Designer"), Contact, Username, Password, Role, and Date of Birth—and save it. The new employee then appears in the list, and I know the system has updated.
