        <p class="text-2">Project Summary: Employee Management System</p>
        <p class="text-1">
          The Employee Management System is a desktop application built using WPF, C#, and .NET 8.0, with MongoDB Atlas as the database. It's designed to help a company manage its employees efficiently, catering to
          different roles like Admins, Managers, HR, and regular Employees. So far, we've implemented core features like adding, viewing, editing, and deleting employee records (CRUD operations), with role-based access
          (e.g., Admins see more details than Guests). We've also added login functionality, connected to MongoDB Atlas for data storage, and set up a tabbed interface in the main window (Employees, Dashboard, Leave
          Requests, Payroll, Admin). Currently, we're working on additional features like expanded user roles, leave requests, and payroll management, ensuring the system is secure, user-friendly, and scalable.

        <p class="text-2 sub-heading">User Stories (Non-Technical Language):</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p class="text-1">
              As a new user, I want to log in with my username and password so that I can access the system securely. When I open the app, I see a login window where I can type my username (e.g., "admin") and password
              (e.g., "admin123"). If I enter the correct details, I’m taken to the main screen with tabs like "Employees" and "Admin." If I click "Cancel," I can still use the app as a Guest but with limited access.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p class="text-1">
              As a Guest user, I want to view a limited list of employees so that I can see who works here without accessing sensitive details. If I skip the login by clicking "Cancel," I enter the app as a Guest. In the
              "Employees" tab, I see a table with just the Name and Position of employees—no Contact or Role details. Restricted tabs like "Admin" and "Payroll" are hidden from me.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="text-2">Manager only:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p class="text-1">
              As a Manager, I want to edit an employee’s details so that I can fix mistakes or update their information. In the "Employees" tab, I select an employee (e.g., "John Doe") from the list and click an "Edit"
              button. I can change details like their Position (e.g., from "Developer" to "Senior Developer") or Contact, then save. The updated details show up in the list right away.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="text-2">HR only:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p class="text-1">
              As an HR person, I want to delete an employee who has left the company so that our records stay accurate. In the "Employees" tab, I select an employee who’s no longer with us (e.g., "Jane Smith"), click a
              "Delete" button, and confirm the action. The employee disappears from the list, ensuring our records only show current staff.

            <p class="text-1">
              As an Admin, I want to see a list of all employees so that I can manage the team effectively. After logging in as an Admin, I go to the "Employees" tab and see a table with everyone’s details, like their
              ID, Name, Position, Contact, Role, and Date of Birth. This helps me keep track of who’s on the team and their roles.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p class="text-1">
              As an Admin, I want to add a new employee to the system so that we can keep our records up to date. In the "Employees" tab, I click a button to add a new employee. I fill in their details—like Name (e.g.,
              "Sarah Lee"), Position (e.g., "Designer"), Contact, Username, Password, Role, and Date of Birth—and save it. The new employee then appears in the list, and I know the system has updated.

          <li>
            <p class="text-1">
              As an Admin, I want to see different tabs based on my role so that I can access the tools I need. After logging in as an Admin, I see all tabs in the main window: Dashboard, Employees, Leave Requests,
              Payroll, and Admin. I can switch between them to manage employees, check payroll, or handle admin tasks, knowing my role gives me full access.

        <p class="text-1">Rallypoint is a tech startup located in Auckland NZ and has contracted you to develop their app for initial release.</p>
        <p class="text-1">Primarily focused on event promotion they have given you a list of must have features for the app which are;</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p class="text-1">Users must be able to view all events posted globally.</p>

          </li>
        </ul>

        <p class="text-1">
          The second part of the required features includes a semi automated verification system for hosts, which will determine whether or not a user is eligible to become a verified host and begin posting events.
        </p>
        <p class="text-1">This verification should include at least one of the following, Identity and/or Location verification.</p>
        <p class="text-1">
          And finally the app should be deployable across mobile platforms either ios and or android, along with web and potentially desktop compatibility. Apart from these mandatory features Rallypoints executives have
          given you developmental discretion in regards to other features of the application.
        </p>

        <p class="text-1">
          As this is a startup company Rallypoint has requested that dev costs and hosting should be kept to a minimum and therefore have chosen to contract you as they believe you will be able to create a functioning
          app that is set up for scaling right from the start all while maintaining budget friendly.
